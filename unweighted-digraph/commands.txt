help                    - show available commands
matrix                  - shows matrix representation
list                    - shows matrix representation
insert <v1>-<v2>        - inserts edges v1 to v2. Eg. insert 1-2-3 4-5
remove <v1>-<v2>        - removes edges v1 to v2. Eg. remove 1-2-3 4-5
dfs <v1>                - performs depth first search starting on v1
bfs <v1>                - performs breadth first search starting on v1
cycle                   - determines whether a cycle exists in the graph
path <v1> <v2>          - determines whether or not a path exists between v1 and v2
connected               - shows all the connected subgraphs in the whole graph
hamilton <v1> <v2>      - checks if a Hamilton path exists from v1 to v2
closure                 - runs the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and displays the transitive closure matrix
randomise dense|sparse  - randomly inserts edges into the graph
clear                   - resets the graph
